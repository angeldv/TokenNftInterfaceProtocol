# TokenNftInterfaceProtocol

## Description

A decentralized NFT marketplace built on StarkNet, leveraging zk-STARKs for verifiable off-chain bidding and optimized transaction throughput with Cairo smart contracts.

## Features

- Defines a standardized metadata schema for NFTs, including support for mutable and immutable attributes.
- Implements a token gating mechanism that restricts access to specific functions based on NFT ownership.
- Provides a secure and efficient method for transferring NFTs between different smart contracts using cross-contract calls.
- Integrates with decentralized storage solutions like IPFS for storing NFT metadata and assets.
- Supports fractionalized NFT ownership through the use of ERC-20 compliant wrapped tokens representing shares.
- Enables lazy minting of NFTs, allowing for the creation of tokens only when they are purchased.
- Includes a permissioned role-based access control system for managing NFT creation and modification rights.
- Offers a gas-optimized implementation for batch minting and transferring multiple NFTs simultaneously.
